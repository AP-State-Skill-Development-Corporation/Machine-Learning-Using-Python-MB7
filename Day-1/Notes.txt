Build a ML model which can predict salary of employee with his experience ?

input ? Experience

output? salary 


Terminology in ML

input/features

output/ target



salary/taregt possible values

employee has 1 year experience how much salary?

1 year   10000, 20000,25000,21000 50000,70000





In a box there there are 50 fruits avaliable (apple , mango ,orange)


build model to predict the which fruit it is with his color?

feature/input   color


target/ouput /  label    fruit name is output

possible target fruit values?
	apple
	or mango
	or orange

------------------------------------
another examples for classifications

find the student  pass/fail


person has cancer or not
	yes/no
	1/0
	true/false




1. we given some examples/past data to the machine
2. we test the model by giving different inputs





In supervised learning
	for training we give the features and target
In unsupervised learning
	there is no target/label





clusting the mobiles defected and non defected


financing/banking
	cluster their clients/ according to the income/spending/loan repaing
	







we want to build ML model which can predict salary of employee with his experience in Google company?


1. Get Data
	past data /prevoius employees experience and salary
	
	a. Google search/web search
	b.  Official website
	c. do the survey/lottory
	d. create dummy values/formula based values

2. Pre-Processing
	1. to identify missing values and handling it
	2. is there any invalid values
		we have patient data for covid detection
		height,weight,temperature(degree)
			      1000
3. Train Model
	a.  identify the algorithm related to problem
	b. we training model with training data
		3 examples for training and 1 example for testing





we tested the student with 10 questions in that student given 6 question correct
no what is performance/accuracy?


(Nocorrect Answers / total questions)*100

(6/10)*100
60% accuracy







To learn ML required softwares
	Anaconda software





take 5 min time to download and install software
